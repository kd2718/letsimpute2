## Hi
My name is Kory. I am a Husband, Father and programmer in that order. I hope to use this blog to talk about Programming, Data Science and Data Engineering. Please join me on this journey!

I have experience working with python and SQL databases for over 5 years. I enjoy spending time with my family, programming, math and board games.
